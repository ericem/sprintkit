SprintKit (based upon the excellent `restkit` HTTP client) allows developers to
add mobile functionality to their Python apps by providing easy access to the
Sprint Developer Sandbox. The Sprint Developer Sandbox is a REST based gateway
to Sprint's network services including; Location, SMS, MMS, Presence, and
Geo-Fences.

Basic access to the Developer Sandbox is Fr$$, so get signed-up and let's see
